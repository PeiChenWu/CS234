# Stanford CS234 Course Projects
This folder includes the work I have done while taking RL course at Stanford, projects like StartCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, DQN for Atari and implementation of RL algorithm such as value / policy evaluation & iterations, DQN, etc. The models were trained on Microsoft Azure. This is a really fun expereince for learning Reinforcement Learning. I really love RL & Machine Learning!

Programming Proficiency & Applications: Python, MuJoCo, Virtual Machine, etc.
